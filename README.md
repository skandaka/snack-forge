**SnackSmith** is a revolutionary web application that transforms the way you create and understand healthy snacks. Move beyond simple recipes and step into a 3D, interactive workspace where you can visually construct energy bars, protein balls, and snack bowls. As you add ingredients, you get instant nutritional feedback and intelligent suggestions from a powerful AI coach, helping you design snacks that are not only delicious but perfectly tailored to your health goals.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive 3D Canvas:** Drag and drop ingredients into a live 3D scene powered by `React Three Fiber` and `three.js`. Watch your snack come to life with procedurally generated models for each ingredient.
* **Real-Time Nutrition Analysis:** A robust Python backend calculates detailed nutritional information (calories, macros, vitamins) for your creation as you build it.
* **Live AI Coaching (Powered by Google Gemini):**
    * **Chat with an AI:** Ask questions about your snack, get suggestions, and receive instant feedback.
    * **One-Click Improvements:** Ask the AI to automatically optimize your snack for goals like "higher protein" or "lower sugar."
    * **AI-Generated Recommendations:** Let the AI invent a completely new snack for you based on your saved preferences.
* **Dynamic UI:** A professional, responsive interface built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring resizable panels and a modern aesthetic.
* **State Management with Zustand:** A centralized store ensures the UI, 3D canvas, and AI coach are always in sync.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** A decoupled frontend and backend architecture for scalability and separation of concerns.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or later)
* **Python** (v3.8 or later) & `pip`
* A **Google Gemini API Key** (see [Configuration](#-environment-variables) section)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/skandaka/snack-forge.git](https://github.com/skandaka/snack-forge.git)
    cd snack-forge
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install

    # Create the environment file (see below)
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

### üîë Environment Variables

The AI features require a Google Gemini API key.

1.  Visit [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/) to create your free API key.
2.  Open the `.env.local` file you created in the `frontend` directory.
3.  Add your API key to the file:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

### Running the Application

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in two separate terminal windows.

1.  **Run the Backend Server (from the `backend` directory):**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    flask run
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Server (from the `frontend` directory):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to start forging snacks!
